# Thomas Edward Hill – Project Portfolio

Welcome. I am Thomas, a data and analytics professional with a background in chemistry, automation engineering, and technical client-facing delivery. After earning a First-Class MChem from Durham University, I spent several years solving real operational problems for global clients before pivoting into data and analytics. My work combines analytical rigour with clear communication and real world problem solving.

## About Me

- MChem Chemistry, First-Class Honours – Durham University  
- Completed a Data Science Programme with HyperionDev in partnership with Imperial College London  
- Developing advanced analytics and consulting skills through the Digital Futures Academy  
- Strong experience working with engineering, operations, and commercial stakeholders  
- Focused on creating clear, actionable insights from complex data  

## Project Highlights

### F1 Tyre Strategy Prediction Project
An end-to-end solution predicting F1 race tyre strategy categories using FastF1 telemetry, engineered stint- and driver-level features, and supervised learning. Includes a full data pipeline, automated feature creation, model training (XGBoost and Random Forest), and a Streamlit application that provides a prediction and visual strategy outputs.  
**Skills:** Python, FastF1, Feature Engineering, XGBoost, Random Forest, Classification, Streamlit.

### WHO Life Expectancy Analysis
A collaborative analytical project exploring global health indicators to model life expectancy. Includes exploratory analysis, feature engineering, regression modelling, and an interactive prediction tool.  
**Skills:** Regression, Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Data Storytelling.

### Ames Housing Price Prediction
A structured end-to-end walkthrough of feature engineering, model fitting, and evaluation for housing price prediction using the Ames dataset.  
**Skills:** EDA, Regression, Feature Selection, Visualisation.

### Python Task Manager
A standalone command-line application for managing users and tasks, featuring authentication, permissions, data storage, and robust validation.  
**Skills:** Python, File I/O, CLI Design.
