## 📂 Project Highlights

### 🌍 WHO Life Expectancy Project
A collaborative project analysing global health data from the World Health Organization. The team performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and built linear regression models to predict life expectancy based on socio-economic and health indicators. The project also included a stand-alone Python function allowing users to input new data and receive life expectancy predictions interactively.  
**Skills:** EDA, Feature Engineering, Linear Regression, Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statistical Modelling, User Interaction Design  
**Contributors:** *Thomas Hill, Dan Bacon, Gus Laughton-Scott, Greg Stark*  
**Presented to:** *Digital Futures Academy*  

### 📈 Linear Regression on Ames Housing Dataset
A complete walkthrough of exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and multiple linear regression to predict house prices using the Ames dataset. Includes model evaluation and export to HTML/PDF.  
**Skills:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Regression Modelling, EDA  

### 🔧 Task Manager (Python)
A file-based command-line application for managing users and tasks. Features include role-based permissions, due date validation, and rich terminal output.  
**Skills:** Python, file I/O, functions, data validation, CLI design, modular code
