# 🏡 Linear Regression – Ames Housing Dataset

This project explores the use of **multiple linear regression** to predict house prices based on the Ames, Iowa dataset. It walks through data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, evaluation, and export of results.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal is to build an interpretable linear regression model that can explain housing price variation using meaningful features such as square footage, location, and condition. Along the way, the project demonstrates key data science techniques including:

- Visual data inspection and cleaning
- Outlier detection and removal
- Feature scaling and encoding
- Model training with Scikit-learn
- Model evaluation using R², RMSE, and residual plots
