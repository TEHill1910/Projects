# 🌍 WHO Life Expectancy Project

A collaborative data analysis and modelling project exploring global health and socio-economic factors influencing life expectancy, based on World Health Organization (WHO) data.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project aimed to explore patterns in global life expectancy through data-driven analysis and predictive modelling. We performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), engineered new features, and built linear regression models to estimate life expectancy based on multiple health and economic indicators.

A standalone Python function was also created to allow users to input new data and generate life expectancy predictions interactively.

## 🧩 Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, renaming variables, and formatting numeric features.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualising trends, distributions, and correlations between key indicators such as GDP, BMI, and mortality rates.  
3. **Feature Engineering (FE)** – Creating ratio and log-transformed variables to reduce skewness and improve model performance.  
4. **Linear Regression (LR) Modelling** – Building and evaluating predictive models using both broad and privacy-conscious variable sets.  
5. **Interactive Prediction Tool** – Implementing a user-friendly Python function to collect inputs and provide predictions based on trained models.  
6. **Presentation & Communication** – Findings and model outcomes were presented to the Digital Futures Academy cohort.
